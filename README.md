# Security--system
website for door security system.
In this project, I had made a web based Door Lock System using NodeMCU, Servo motor and Adafruit IO. Here NodeMCU will act as the main controller and connect the user to the door lock system using the Internet. This allows the user to lock/unlock his Homeâ€™s door lock by using a website from anywhere in the world.
